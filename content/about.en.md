Welcome to Casa de JuJu 👋🏼
{{< /lead >}}

I’m an [INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) from 🇨🇴, and currently living in 🇳🇴

I have been working as a [kambo practitioner](https://iakp.org/user/637/) 🐸 since 2017, and at [Deichman](https://deichman.no/ansatte/149d59f3-c3ef-431f-9dff-da53e9d2b948) 📚 since 2022.

I have a passion for privacy, sociology, economy, health and masculine/feminine dynamics. 
My main mission is to reconnect with nature through [rewilding strategies](https://www.arthurhaines.com/blog/2014/6/13/rewilding-fundamentals).

This website serves as my timeline & online identity inspired by some [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/) principles.
