The hostility towards cash in Norway is astounding. Just today I tried to pay twice with cash, but was forced to pay with plastic. To accept cash for most payments in Norway is [mandatory](https://www.norges-bank.no/en/topics/notes-and-coins/the-right-to-pay-cash/), but there is no real enforcement. Most Norwegians pay with cards or Vipps without any second thought, creating data sets for banks and financial corporations that have huge privacy implications. But when I ask to pay with crypto or [goldbacks](https://www.goldback.com/) at the coffee shop, people look at me like I'm an alien. 

Any centralized, digital system is by its nature compromised, but I guess Norwegians are just waiting for a detonating wake-up call. Regulators are also speeding up the process to [ban the NOK 1000-bill](https://www.nrk.no/rogaland/naeringslivet_-skrot-tusenlappen-1.17656789). Gentle reminder: It's not a crime to want privacy.

Cash is by far the most anonymous payment available today, and losing the right to use cash would be considered a major loss in your right to transact freely. If you are in Norway, and your cash is not accepted - please file a complaint with the Norwegian Consumer Authority (Forbrukertilsynet) [here](https://www.forbrukertilsynet.no/english/complaints-and-conflicts).
