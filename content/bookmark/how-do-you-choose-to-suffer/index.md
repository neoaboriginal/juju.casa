A summary of quotes:

*- Pleasure is an easy question. And pretty much all of us have similar answers. The more interesting question is the pain.*

*- To get good at dealing with negative experiences is to get good at dealing with life.*

*- I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love not with the fight, but only the victory.*
