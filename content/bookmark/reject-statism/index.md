summary: "The world has long been governed by systems of statism—systems built on force, coercion, and the suppression of individual sovereignty. These systems present themselves as protectors of order and providers of security, yet at their core, they perpetuate violence, extortion, and control."  # Short description, the same as 'description' in the OpenGraph preview

*History has shown that the greatest atrocities are committed by states under the banner of law and order. Genocide, war, slavery, and oppression are all products of state power. To bow to such an institution is to betray one’s own humanity.*
