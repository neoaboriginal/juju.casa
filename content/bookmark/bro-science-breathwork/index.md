I've been pondering a lot about breathing for some years now, and the more I learn about breath - the more I understand the value of not pushing excessively with "bro science". We've all experienced the highs with breathing, often popularized through Wim Hof and similar techniques. But I'm feeling a greater, more sustained, value with easy and gentle methods like [conscious breathing](https://www.consciousbreathing.com/) and [buteyko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteyko_method). Bring back the yin and the soft approaches. Many of you are just starting to establish that connection, and you will need patience.
