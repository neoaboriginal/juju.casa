This why all trade/labor/worker unions are lost. Idleness and leisure is no longer the goal. It’s all about wages and rights, not about a life outside your confined cubicle/workplace. As P.J. O’ Rourke says; *It’s not an endlessly expanding list of rights […] That’s not freedom, that’s dependency. Those aren’t rights, those are the rations of slavery – hay and a barn for human cattle.*

At which death-bed did you hear remorse about not working those extra hours? Also I think *a lot* of people are workaholics to distract them from the pains of their daily life (Who can blame them in these post-modern times?). Some people use drugs, but most people sign up for a full-time job.
