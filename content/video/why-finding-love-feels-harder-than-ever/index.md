Negative take: If you hate being single just try dating today. You'll enjoy being single much more.

Positive take: Would you rather be alone or with a woman who tests you constantly? She tests you to feel your power, not your weakness.

Conclusion: Date a woman that represents what you would want your daughter to be like.
