I’d also feel embarrassed to promote Bitcoin nowadays. What we’re seeing is just the NGUC (Number Go Up Crowd) pumping their bags, while real P2P freedom money like Monero and Zano actually deliver on the original promise.

At what price will Bitcoin change the world? The endgame was supposed to be creating a new economy, not just trading back into fiat. This is what selling your crypto-anarchist soul looks like.

Where are all the liberty-minded BTC-maxis who stood with Roger Ver’s vision? Nowhere to be found. Instead, they’re too busy celebrating ETFs and Wall Street adoption.

Privacy? Bitcoin is a joke in this department. You can literally google a bitcoin address and read someone’s entire financial history. How is this the future of money?

If we want actual financial freedom, we need to look beyond Bitcoin’s compromised vision. The revolution will come from truly private, fungible cryptocurrencies that put financial sovereignty back in the hands of regular people.
