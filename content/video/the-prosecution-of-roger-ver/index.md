*They call him “Bitcoin Jesus,” though he despises the nickname. His real name is Roger Ver. At any moment, Roger could be arrested for alleged tax evasion and mail fraud. But anyone familiar with his case knows the truth: Roger’s only “crime” was being the very first investor and passionate advocate for Bitcoin. For that, he faces 109 years in federal prison.

As devastating as this is for Roger, this case is less about him and more about you.

Roger is being persecuted as a warning from corrupt lawmakers who aim to set a precedent that could threaten your ability to own, trade, and profit from cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just about Roger’s freedom; it’s about the future of financial sovereignty for us all.*
