Could be an idea to respect your natural cycles.

*Men are solar, women are lunar.*

*Men have a 24 hour testosterone testosterone cycle which peaks in the morning and declines through the day.*

*Women have a 28 day hormonal cycle that changes with the 28 day cycle of the moon.*

*Men are meant to work hard in the morning and around lunch time and relax later in the day.*

*Women are meant to sync their activities to where they are within their 28 day cycle and vary their activities widely day to day.*

*The 9-5 work life is built for this solar cycle.*
