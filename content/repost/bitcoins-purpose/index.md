Bitcoin as digital gold is a blasphemic statement.

*Bitcoin’s purpose is crystal clear. Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper, "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System," explicitly outlines Bitcoin as digital cash. The whitepaper discusses creating a decentralized currency for everyday transactions, not a store of value like digital gold. Read the whitepaper and see for yourself.*

*1/ The title of the whitepaper itself - "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" - states the purpose directly: Bitcoin was meant to be used as cash.*

*2/ The whitepaper details how Bitcoin enables direct online payments without going through a financial institution, emphasizing peer-to-peer transactions.*

*3/ Nowhere in the whitepaper does Satoshi mention "digital gold." The focus is on solving the double-spending problem and providing a decentralized method for transferring value.*

*4/ As Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a store of value or digital gold, we must revisit its original purpose. Bitcoin was designed to facilitate everyday transactions, making financial interactions more private and decentralized.*

*5/ Let’s keep the conversation alive about Bitcoin’s true purpose and ensure it remains a tool for financial freedom.*

*Bitcoin Cash has remained true to this vision and other projects like Zano, Monero (XMR), Zcash, Litecoin, and Dash have filled the void and even improved upon the original vision by adding privacy features.*
