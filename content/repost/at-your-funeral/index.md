_At your funeral, friends and family will argue over who gets your belongings.<br>People will talk about the food and the venue.<br>Your life will be summarized in 2-3 paragraphs.<br>Conversations will shift from your life to their lives.<br>Your friends will drive away thinking about what‚Äôs next on their to-do list.<br>Some people won't be able to make it because "something came up."<br>And most of the people you know today won‚Äôt even be there.<br>You‚Äôre gonna die.<br>People will move on (in weeks not years).<br>Do what you want._
